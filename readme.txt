To use any of the Material Design icons on your WordPress site you have two options:

__HTML__

**Examples**

Bell icon

`<i class="mdi mdi-bell"></i>`


__Shortcode__

Don't want to worry about HTML tags?  You can use a shortcode in your posts, pages and even widgets to display a Material Design icon.

The shortcode to use is `[icon name=name-of-icon]`, where name=X is the class of the icon you would like to use.

**Examples**

Amazon icon

`[mdi-icon name="amazon"]`
