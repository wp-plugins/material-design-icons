A full list of the 1000+ Material Design Icons icons is available: [materialdesignicons.com/](http://materialdesignicons.com/)

##Usage Instructions

To use any of the Material Design icons on your WordPress site you have two options:

__HTML__

**Examples**

Bell icon

`<i class="mdi mdi-bell"></i>`


__Shortcode__

Don't want to worry about HTML tags?  You can use a shortcode in your posts, pages and even widgets to display a Material Design icon.

The shortcode to use is `[icon name=name-of-icon]`, where name=X is the class of the icon you would like to use.

**Examples**

Amazon icon

`[mdi-icon name="amazon"]`

##Installation

1. Upload to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. Use one of the two usage methods (HTML or Shortcode) within the content of your posts or pages.   

4. Use either the HTML or Shortcode methods inside your text widgets.
